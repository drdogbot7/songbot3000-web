And We All Go Bump
I Love You, Darling, If You Never Have any Cash Money in Your Pocketbook During Your Entire Life in This World, But I Won't Be With You, Darling, If You Never Have any Cash Money in Your Pocketbook During Your Entire Life in This World, or Anywhere Else You Might Go with Nothin', Because I Don't Need Nobody to Help Me Do Bad, I Can Starve to Death by Myself, Sweetheart, So Try and Forget Me, But Always Remember That I Love You More Than Any Woman I've Ever Known in My Life, Because That Night I Went Over to Your House and Got Drunk and Fell Out on the Couch and Went to Sleep, You Didn't Mess with None of the Money That Was Left in My Wallet, Because You Must Have Known Deep Down in Your Heart That if I'd Have Came To and Found Some of My Hard-Earned Money Gone, I'd Have Went Home and Got a 2x4 That I'd Been Soaking in Motor Oil Since 1939, and I'd Have Came Back Searchin' for Ya, and if I'd Have Found You Anywhere on Earth with Any Portions of My Money in Your Bag, I'd Have Took My Greasy 2x4, Knowing That It Wouldn't Break, Bend or Splinter, and Try to Cave Your Skull in With It Blues

The role of Gadget went through two different voice actors for the pilot episode before Don Adams was cast. In the first version of the pilot episode, the voice of Gadget was provided by Gary Owens, who voiced Inspector Gadget in a deep-toned, British-sounding way. A second version of the pilot was made with the only difference being Jesse White re-recording all of Owens' dialogue with an impression of Maxwell Smart of Get Smart (played by Don Adams), one of the series' inspirations (a third version of the pilot was made for broadcast with Frank Welker re-recording one line as Gadget to explain away the mustache). Eventually, producers decided to cast actor Don Adams himself to get the full effect. Adams' took over the role with the first episode of the regular series, "Monster Lake".
